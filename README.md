			Hello sales super stars! My name is Matthew Taylor Scott, and I'm a sales professional 
            with a B.S. in Biology and a Master of Business Administration that I achieved during my 5 years of 
            working for Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the largest Contract Development & Manufacturing 
            Organizations. I gained knowledge in the Pharma & Biotech manufacturing industry delivering results 
            where I exceeded my sales targets and was recognized for creating training programs to train a total 
            of 8 new hires. This resulted in management adding these modules to the company’s New Hire Onboarding 
            training process.
			That said, I’ve utilized my software enginnering skills to develop this website hosting these sales 
            training programs for future new hires to learn these skills.
			Practice the content on this website and you will be on your way to becoming an inside sales master 
            of pharma services.
			Happy Hunting!
